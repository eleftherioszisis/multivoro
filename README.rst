Parallel cell-based 3D voronoi tessellations
--------------------------------------------


multivoro is a python library that allows building 3D Voronoi/Laguerre tessellations with `voro++ <voro_site_>`_ exposed in python via the nanobind_ library.
It leverages the latest `multi-threaded extension of Voro++ <voro_mthread_>`_ to allow computing the voronoi cells in parallel.

Codebases
---------
* `Voro++ <voro_repo_>`_
* nanobind_

Installation
------------

If one is on a Linux platform, one should be able to use the compiled Python wheels.
This is the recommended way.

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install multivoro

To build multivoro from source in Ubuntu:

.. code-block:: bash

   # python versions to choose from: [python3.8-python3.12]
   sudo apt install openmp python3.10-dev python3.10-venv
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/eleftherioszisis/multivoro.git
   python3.10 -mvenv venv && source ./venv/bin/activate
   cd multivoro && pip install .

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python

   from multivoro import compute_voronoi

   cells = compute_voronoi(
       points=[[-1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]],
       radii=[1.0, 1.0],
       limits=[[-2.0, -1.0, -1.0], [2.0, 1.0, 1.0]],
   )

   for cell in cells:
       print(cell.get_vertices())
       print(cell.get_neighbors())
       print(cell.get_face_vertices())
